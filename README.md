# React Native Loop Habit Tracker

This is a React Native port of the original [Loop Habit Tracker for Android](https://github.com/iSoron/uhabits). This project is still at a very early stage (see the TODO section below).

The main intent of this project is to provide the same habit tracking experience on iOS devices.
